# Bitmap2600

This is the website code for a simple web app that aids in the creation of player sprite bitmaps for the Atari 2600.

Select a color for each scanline and fill in the pixels.

There are 9 scanlines (8 for graphics and an extra for blank padding) as is a common 2600 convention.

When ready click generate to create the code to copy into your project.
