# Bitmap 2600

This is the code for a simple web app that aids in the creation of player sprite bitmaps for the Atari 2600.

Select a color for each scanline and fill in the pixels.

There are 8 scanlines to edit but an extra blank scanline is added for padding during code generation as it is a common 2600 convention.

Any color or scanline that is left blank will default to black in the color map. This is just to take up space in memory and the color won't really matter because the line won't get drawn anyway.

When ready click create to create the code to copy into your project.

The color palette follows the NTSC standard. I may add PAL in the future.
