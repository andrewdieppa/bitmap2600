# Bitmap2600

This is the code for a simple web app that aids in the creation of player sprite bitmaps for the Atari 2600.

Select a color for each scanline and fill in the pixels.

There are 8 scanlines to edit but an extra blank scanline is added for padding during code generation as it is a common 2600 convention.

When ready click generate to create the code to copy into your project.
